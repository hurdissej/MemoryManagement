To run benchmarks:
* Modify program.cs - select one of the private methods for the benchmarks you would like to run

Most up to date results are in the BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts folder 

ToDo: 
* Eventually tidy this up so it takes a command line arg 
* String examples - give some examples of string interning
